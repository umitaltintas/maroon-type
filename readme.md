## Introduction

The Maroon Type is designed to help you improve your Maroon skills. Whether you're an aspiring novelist or just tired of the slow, awkward key-pecking, this app will help you type faster and more accurately. Plus, it's a lot cheaper than hiring a Maroon tutor.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/umitaltintas/maroon-type
    cd Maroon-Type
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Application:**
    Fire up the app and start Maroon away:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

When you start the app, you'll be greeted by a random piece of text. Your job is to type it as quickly and accurately as possible. Simple, right? Here's a quick rundown:

- **Start Maroon:** Begin Maroon the displayed text. The app will start the timer as soon as you press the first key.
- **Backspace:** Made a mistake? No worries, just hit backspace. But remember, every backspace counts against your accuracy.
- **Statistics:** Your WPM (Words Per Minute) and accuracy will be displayed in real-time.
- **Restart:** Finished? Hit the "Restart" button to try again with a new text.

## Customization

Feeling fancy? Customize the app to your heart's content. Open the `settings.json` file to tweak the following settings:

- **font_name:** Change the font to one that makes your Maroon look even cooler.
- **font_size:** Increase or decrease the font size to match your preference.
- **bg_color:** Customize the background color (Hex codes only, please).
- **text_color:** Change the text color (yes, Hex codes here too).
- **difficulty:** Choose between "Easy", "Medium", and "Hard". (Warning: Hard mode might induce finger cramps).

## Contributing
